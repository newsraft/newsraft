# Project goals

Main objective of Newsraft program is to do almost everything
[Newsboat](https://newsboat.org) does, but with:

* grouping of feeds into updatable sections instead of meta-feeds;

* faster feed updates;

* 4 times smaller codebase;

* less bloated dependencies.

These cool advantages, however, make some Newsboat features bypassed by
Newsraft, notably:

* feed entries filtering;

* feed transformations;

* integration with third-party services.

Basically Newsraft is lightweight version of Newsboat, and it's well suited
for those who don't feel like using complex feed operations and third-party
services integration.

SINCE PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, THESE STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
