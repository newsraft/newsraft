# This is an example of valid feeds file for feedeater.

# Lines with number sign (#) at the beginning are comments,
# they are completely ignored by the parser as well as empty lines.

# To subscribe to feed you have to add a line with its URL:
http://example.org/feed1.xml

# If you want to assign feed a name, put a double quoted string after its URL:
http://example.org/feed2.xml "News of my GNU/Linux distribution"

# Lines with percent sign (%) at the beginning are decorations.
# You can see them in menu, but can never select:
%--------------------<{ Favorite Podcasts }>--------------------
# To be able to use feed in a multi-feed, you have to tag it.
# Tag is a word of latin alphabet letters, arabic digits and hyphens.
# Using any other symbols is discouraged. All tags of feed have to
# be put after feed's name (or after URL if name is omitted).
http://example.org/feed3.xml "Local news report" news real-world
http://example.org/feed4.xml "Technology news digest" news tech

# Lines with at sign (@) at the beginning are multi-feeds,
# they are used to access items of multiple feeds that satisfy the
# tag expression. You also can update multi-feed as if you were updating
# feeds with these tags individually. To determine the feeds that will be
# included in the multi-feed, you have to write a tag expression.
# In tag expression you can use tag names, logical operators and round
# brackets. Whitespace does not matter. Multi-feeds can be named just like
# a regular feeds, with a double quoted string:
@ tech & (news | release-notes) "Technology news & project releases"

# Fun fact: decorations can be empty!
