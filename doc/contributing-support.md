## Spreading the word

Unfortunately RSS slows down in popularity and it risks being forgotten by the
next generations. Tell your friends about web syndication and how do you think
it is cool. No need to specifically promote Newsboat or Newsraft (let's admit,
these are quite geeky), there are a lot of good GUI feed readers that are
convenient to use for people who are not so passionate about console interfaces.

## Helping others

Join #newsraft channel on the [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net) network and politely
answer to people's questions if you know the solution.
