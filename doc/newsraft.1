.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Newsraft is a small text based program for reading syndication feeds - it
enables you to obtain content from many blogs and platforms and view all this
via one single interface in an efficient and streamlined manner.\&

.SH STARTER GUIDE
.P
To start using Newsraft you have to create a \fBfeeds\fR file with the list of links
that point to feeds you want to receive news from.\& Format of this file and valid
paths for the location of this file are discussed in the \fBFEEDS FILE\fR section.\&
.P
When your \fBfeeds\fR file is ready, you can launch Newsraft.\& Navigation in the
interface is carried out by the same keys as in the \fBvi\fR(1) text editor.\& There
are only 4 menus you'\&re gonna deal with: \fIsections menu\fR, \fIfeeds menu\fR,
\fIitems menu\fR and \fIpager menu\fR.\&
.P
\fISections menu\fR consists of section entries which are needed to organize feeds
in groups to be able to process them in bulk.\& They are kind of directories for
feeds.\& If you didn'\&t specify any section declarations in your \fBfeeds\fR file then
you will get to the \fIfeeds menu\fR straightaway.\&
.P
\fIFeeds menu\fR consists of feed entries.\& Every feed entry contains news downloaded
from one specific source which you have set in \fBfeeds\fR file.\& To update a single
feed you have to select it and press \fBr\fR.\& If you want to update all feeds,
\fBCtrl-R\fR (or \fB^R\fR for short) will do this fine.\& From \fIfeeds menu\fR you can get to
the \fIitems menu\fR by entering some feed.\&
.P
\fIItems menu\fR consists of feed item entries (i.\& e.\& single pieces of news) which
you get when you update feeds in the previous menu.\& Every feed item entry has
two switchable properties - read state and importance state.\& Keys to change read
state: \fBd\fR to mark read, \fBD\fR to mark unread, \fB^D\fR to mark everything read.\& Keys
to change importance state: \fBf\fR to flag important, \fBF\fR to flag unimportant.\& To
view item'\&s content you have to go to \fIpager menu\fR by entering selected item.\&
.P
\fIPager menu\fR will display some details about selected item and render its
content if it was provided by feed.\& Usually feed item entries have a links
section with one link pointing to a related web page and several links that were
mentioned in the item'\&s content.\& You can copy these links into your clipboard
with \fBy\fR key and open them in your web browser with \fBo\fR key.\& To target a key
action to link with a specific index you have to prefix your key with this
index.\& For example, \fB5y\fR will copy fifth link and \fB17o\fR will open seventeenth
link in the web browser.\& You can also setup custom command bindings to execute
any commands with these links.\& Consider this \fBconfig\fR file:
.P
.RS 4
\fIbind m exec mpv "%l"\fR
.br
\fIbind f exec feh "%l"\fR
.P
.RE
With this you will be able to open any link in \fBmpv\fR(1) and \fBfeh\fR(1) directly
from your terminal!\& Isn'\&t it awesome?\& It is freaking amazing!\&
.P
For both \fIsections menu\fR and \fIfeeds menu\fR there is a special explore mode.\& You
can toggle it by pressing the \fBtab\fR key (\fB^I\fR).\& It'\&s truly miraculous: it shows
all the news in the current context (i.\& e.\& in \fIsections menu\fR it will show you
all the news in the database, whereas in \fIfeeds menu\fR it will show you all the
news of feeds in the current \fIfeeds menu\fR).\& This mode may come in handy when you
want to quickly scroll through all the news without switching between sections
and feeds back and forth.\&
.P
And for dessert, I'\&ll tell you about search functionality.\& You can type \fB/\fR in
\fIitems menu\fR to start search input - enter the desired query here and press
\fBEnter\fR.\& This will generate a new list of items based on given search query.\& To
return to the original items list, you just need to make an empty search
(press \fB/\fR and \fBEnter\fR in sequence).\& Searching like that in \fIsections menu\fR and
\fIfeeds menu\fR will automatically enable explore mode and apply your search query.\&
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
.SS FEEDS FILE
.P
This file contains feed entries that Newsraft will display and process.\& There
are 4 types of lines in \fBfeeds\fR file.\&
.P
Feed lines start with a URL.\& After at least one whitespace character, the name
of the feed may be specified - it must be enclosed in double quotes.\& For
example:
.P
.RS 4
\fIhttps://example.\&org/feed.\&xml "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.P
.RE
Generator lines start with a command enclosed in \fB$()\fR.\& These act just like feed
lines but instead of fetching resources from a remote server they use the output
of the specified command to obtain the content.\&
.P
.RS 4
\fI$(cat ~/local-feed.\&xml) "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.P
.RE
Section lines start with \fB@\fR character.\& After any number of whitespace characters,
the name of the section must be specified.\& For example:
.P
.RS 4
\fI@ Software Releases\fR
.P
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:
.P
.RS 4
\fI# Look closely.\& The beautiful may be small.\&\fR
.P
.RE
Both feed and section lines allow you to set individual settings for them.\& The
syntax is as follows:
.P
.RS 4
\fI@ Lorem Ipsum < reload-period 1440\fR
.br
\fIhttps://example.\&org/feed.\&xml "Lorem Ipsum Blog" < reload-period 60\fR
.P
.RE
Settings set for feeds take precedence over the settings specified for sections.\&
Not every setting supports individual assignment - only settings with \fBscalable\fR
mark in \fBSETTINGS\fR section do.\&

.SS CONFIG FILE
.P
This file is used to override default settings and bindings of Newsraft.\&
Presence of \fBconfig\fR file is totally optional and Newsraft will work without it
just fine.\& There are 3 types of lines in \fBconfig\fR file.\&
.P
Setting lines start with a setting name and end with a setting value.\& Available
settings are listed in the \fBSETTINGS\fR and \fBCOLOR SETTINGS\fR sections.\& Here are a
couple of examples:
.P
.RS 4
\fIscrolloff 5000\fR
.br
\fIlist-entry-date-format "%D"\fR
.br
\fIfeeds-menu-paramount-explore true\fR
.P
.RE
Binding lines start with the \fBbind\fR word.\& They define actions that are performed
when certain keys are pressed.\& Complete list of assigned actions can be found in
the \fBACTIONS\fR section.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction\fR
.P
.RE
There is also a way to assign command bindings.\& When a key with assigned command
binding is pressed, the specifiers in the \fIcommand\fR are replaced with values of
the corresponding entry and the command is executed.\& You can find which
specifiers are available in the description of the \fImenu-item-entry-format\fR
setting.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fBexec\fR \fIcommand\fR
.P
.RE
Binding lines support assigning multiple actions to one key.\& Assigned actions
must be separated with semicolon symbols, for example:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction1\fR; \fIaction2\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand1\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand2\fR; \fIaction5\fR
.P
.RE
In case you want to disable some binding which was set in Newsraft by default,
you can use a line according to this format:
.P
.RS 4
\fBunbind\fR key
.P
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:
.P
.RS 4
\fI# Good design is as little design as possible.\&\fR

.SS DATABASE FILE
.P
This file stores everything you download from feeds in \fBsqlite3\fR(1) format.\&

it will be very sad.\&

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
Newsraft'\&s behavior depends on the environment variables set, however not all
environment variables affect Newsraft directly - many environment variables
affect libraries that Newsraft is built on.\& Thus, \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl\fR(3)
recognize a large number of different environment variables which you can learn
more about on \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl-env\fR(3) respectively.\&
.P
However, there is one significant \fBncurses\fR(3) environment variable that is
worth mentioning here - \fBESCDELAY\fR.\& It sets delay for reading Escape key.\& It
may surprise you that its default value is 1000 ms, which is well explained
in \fBncurses\fR(3), but many may prefer a value much less than that or even 0.\&
