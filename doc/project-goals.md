# Project goals

Main objective of Newsraft project is to do almost everything [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org) does, but:

* with 3 times smaller codebase;

* with faster feed updates;

* with less dependencies.

These cool advantages, however, make some Newsboat features bypassed, notably:

* feed entries filtering;

* feed transformations;

* integration with third-party services.

SINCE PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, THESE STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
