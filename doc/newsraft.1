.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Newsraft is a small text based program for reading syndication feeds.\& It obtains

streamlined user interface.\&

.SH STARTER GUIDE
.PP
To start using Newsraft you have to create a \fBfeeds\fR file with the list of links
to feeds you want to receive news from.\& Check out \fBFEEDS FILE\fR section for file
syntax and valid paths.\&
.PP
When \fBfeeds\fR file is ready, you can launch Newsraft.\& There are only 4 menus you
will have to deal with: \fIsections\fR, \fIfeeds\fR, \fIitems\fR and \fIpager\fR.\& Default binds
are listed in \fBACTIONS\fR section.\&
.PP
\fISections\fR menu consists of section entries which are needed to organize feeds
in groups to be able to process them in bulk.\& They are kind of directories for
feeds.\& If you didn'\&t specify any section declarations in your \fBfeeds\fR file then
you will get to the \fIfeeds\fR menu straightaway.\&
.PP
\fIFeeds\fR menu consists of feed entries.\& Every feed entry contains news downloaded
from one specific source which you have set in \fBfeeds\fR file.\& To update a single
feed you have to select it and press \fBr\fR or \fBR\fR if you want to update all feeds.\&
From \fIfeeds\fR menu you can get to the \fIitems\fR menu by entering some feed.\&
.PP
\fIItems\fR menu consists of feed item entries (i.\& e.\& single pieces of news) which
you get when you update feeds in the previous menu.\& Every feed item entry has
two switchable properties - read state and importance state.\& Keys to change read
state: \fBd\fR to mark read, \fBD\fR to mark unread, \fB^D\fR to mark everything read.\& Keys
to change importance state: \fBf\fR to flag important, \fBF\fR to flag unimportant.\& To
view item'\&s content you have to go to \fIpager\fR menu by entering selected item.\&
.PP
\fIPager\fR menu will display some details about selected item and render its
content if it was provided by feed.\& Usually feed item entries have a links
section with one link pointing to a related web page and several links that were
mentioned in the item'\&s content.\& You can copy these links into your clipboard
with \fBy\fR key and open them in your web browser with \fBo\fR key.\& To target a key
action to link with a specific index you have to prefix your key with this
index.\& For example, \fB5y\fR will copy fifth link and \fB17o\fR will open seventeenth
link in the web browser.\& You can also setup custom command bindings to execute
any commands with these links.\& Consider this \fBconfig\fR file:
.PP
.RS 4
\fIbind m exec mpv "%l"\fR
.br
\fIbind f exec feh "%l"\fR
.PP
.RE
With this you will be able to open any link in \fBmpv\fR(1) and \fBfeh\fR(1) directly
from your terminal!\& Isn'\&t it awesome?\& It is freaking amazing!\&
.PP
For both \fIsections\fR menu and \fIfeeds\fR menu there is a special explore mode.\& You
can toggle it by pressing the \fBtab\fR key.\& It'\&s truly miraculous: it reveals all
the news in the current context (combines news from all feeds of the current
menu into one list).\& This mode may come in handy when you want to quickly scroll
through all the news without switching between sections and feeds back and forth.\&
.PP
And for dessert, I'\&ll tell you about search functionality.\& You can type \fB/\fR to
begin search input - enter the desired query here and press \fBEnter\fR.\& This will
open an \fIitems\fR menu with a search query applied.\& To make filtering go away just
make an empty search (press \fB/\fR and \fBEnter\fR in series).\&
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
.SS FEEDS FILE
.PP
This file contains feed entries that Newsraft will display and process.\& There
are 4 types of lines in \fBfeeds\fR file.\&
.PP
Feed lines start with a URL.\& After at least one whitespace character, the name
of the feed may be specified - it must be enclosed in double quotes.\& For
example:
.PP
.RS 4
\fIhttps://example.\&org/feed.\&xml "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.PP
.RE
Generator lines start with a command enclosed in \fB$()\fR.\& These act just like feed
lines but instead of fetching resources from a remote server they use the output
of the specified command to obtain the content.\&
.PP
.RS 4
\fI$(cat ~/local-feed.\&xml) "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.PP
.RE
Section lines start with \fB@\fR character.\& After any number of whitespace characters,
the name of the section must be specified.\& For example:
.PP
.RS 4
\fI@ Software Releases\fR
.PP
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:
.PP
.RS 4
\fI# Look closely.\& The beautiful may be small.\&\fR
.PP
.RE
Both feed and section lines allow you to set individual settings and binds for
them.\& The syntax is as follows:
.PP
.RS 4
\fI@ Lorem Ipsum < reload-period 1440\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed1.\&xml "Dolor Sit" < reload-period 60; item-limit 500\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed2.\&xml "Id Est" < bind b mark-read; exec book.\&sh "%l"\fR
.PP
.RE
Settings set for feeds take precedence over the settings specified for sections.\&
Not every setting supports individual assignment - only settings with \fBscalable\fR
mark in \fBSETTINGS\fR section do.\&

.SS CONFIG FILE
.PP
This file is used to override default settings and bindings of Newsraft.\&
Presence of \fBconfig\fR file is totally optional and Newsraft will work without it
just fine.\& There are 3 types of lines in \fBconfig\fR file.\&
.PP
Setting lines start with a setting name and end with a setting value.\& Available
settings are listed in the \fBSETTINGS\fR and \fBCOLOR SETTINGS\fR sections.\& Here are a
couple of examples:
.PP
.RS 4
\fIscrolloff 5000\fR
.br
\fIlist-entry-date-format "%D"\fR
.br
\fIfeeds-menu-paramount-explore true\fR
.PP
.RE
Binding lines start with the \fBbind\fR word.\& They define actions that are performed
when certain keys are pressed.\& Complete list of assigned actions can be found in
the \fBACTIONS\fR section.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.PP
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction\fR
.PP
.RE
There is also a way to assign command bindings.\& When a key with assigned command
binding is pressed, the specifiers in the \fIcommand\fR are replaced with values of
the corresponding entry and the command is executed.\& You can find which
specifiers are available in the description of the \fImenu-item-entry-format\fR
setting.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.PP
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fBexec\fR \fIcommand\fR
.PP
.RE
Binding lines support assigning multiple actions to one key.\& Assigned actions
must be separated with semicolon symbols, for example:
.PP
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction1\fR; \fIaction2\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand1\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand2\fR; \fIaction5\fR
.PP
.RE
In case you want to disable some binding which was set in Newsraft by default,
you can use a line according to this format:
.PP
.RS 4
\fBunbind\fR key
.PP
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:
.PP
.RS 4
\fI# Good design is as little design as possible.\&\fR

.SS DATABASE FILE
.PP
This file stores everything you download from feeds in \fBsqlite3\fR(1) format.\&

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
Newsraft'\&s behavior depends on the environment variables set, however not all
environment variables affect Newsraft directly - many environment variables
affect libraries that Newsraft is built on.\& Thus, \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl\fR(3)
recognize a large number of different environment variables which you can learn
more about on \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl-env\fR(3) respectively.\&
.PP
However, there is one significant \fBncurses\fR(3) environment variable that is
worth mentioning here - \fBESCDELAY\fR.\& It sets delay for reading Escape key.\& It
may surprise you that its default value is 1000 ms, which is well explained
in \fBncurses\fR(3), but many may prefer a value much less than that or even 0.\&
