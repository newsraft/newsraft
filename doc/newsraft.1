.SH STARTER GUIDE
.P
To start using Newsraft you have to create a \fBfeeds\fR file with the list of links
that point to feeds you want to receive news from.\& Format of this file and valid
paths for the location of this file are discussed in the \fBFEEDS FILE\fR section.\&
.P
When your \fBfeeds\fR file is ready, you can launch Newsraft.\& Navigation in the
interface is carried out by the same keys as in the \fBvi\fR(1) text editor.\& There
are only 4 menus you'\&re gonna deal with: \fIsections menu\fR, \fIfeeds menu\fR,
\fIitems menu\fR and \fIpager menu\fR.\&
.P
\fISections menu\fR consists of section entries which are needed to organize feeds
in groups to be able to process them in bulk.\& They are kind of directories for
feeds.\& If you didn'\&t specify any section declarations in your \fBfeeds\fR file then
you will get to the \fIfeeds menu\fR straightaway.\&
.P
\fIFeeds menu\fR consists of feed entries.\& Every feed entry contains news downloaded
from one specific source which you have set in \fBfeeds\fR file.\& To update a single
feed you have to select it and press \fBr\fR.\& If you want to update all feeds,
\fBCtrl-R\fR (or \fB^R\fR for short) will do this fine.\& From \fIfeeds menu\fR you can get to
the \fIitems menu\fR by entering some feed.\&
.P
\fIItems menu\fR consists of feed item entries (i.\& e.\& single pieces of news) which
you get when you update feeds in the previous menu.\& Every feed item entry has
two switchable properties - read state and importance state.\& Keys to force read
state change: \fBd\fR to mark read, \fBD\fR to mark unread, \fB^D\fR to mark everything
read.\& Keys to force importance state change: \fBi\fR to mark important, \fBI\fR to mark
unimportant.\& To view item'\&s content you have to go to \fIpager menu\fR by entering
selected item.\&
.P
\fIPager menu\fR will display some details about selected item and render its
content if it was provided by feed.\& Usually feed item entries have a links
section with one link pointing to a related web page and several links that were
mentioned in the item'\&s content.\& You can copy these links into your clipboard
with \fBy\fR key and open them in your web browser with \fBo\fR key.\& To target a key
action to link with a specific index you have to prefix your key with this
index.\& For example, \fB5y\fR will copy fifth link and \fB17o\fR will open seventeenth
link in the web browser.\& You can also setup custom command bindings to execute
any commands with these links.\& Consider this \fBconfig\fR file:
.P
.RS 4
\fIbind m exec mpv "%l"\fR
.br
\fIbind f exec feh "%l"\fR
.P
.RE
With this you will be able to open any link in \fBmpv\fR(1) and \fBfeh\fR(1) directly
from your terminal!\& Isn'\&t it awesome?\& It is freaking amazing!\&
.P
For both \fIsections menu\fR and \fIfeeds menu\fR there is a special view mode - explore
mode.\& You can toggle this mode by pressing the \fBe\fR key in either \fIsections menu\fR
or \fIfeeds menu\fR.\& What it does is truly miraculous - it lists all the feed item
entries in the current scope (i.\& e.\& explore mode in \fIsections menu\fR will show
you all the feed item entries in the database, while in \fIfeeds menu\fR it will
show you all the feed item entries of feeds in the current \fIfeeds menu\fR).\& This
mode may come in handy when you want to quickly scroll through all the news
without switching between sections and feeds back and forth.\&
.P
And for dessert, I'\&ll tell you about search functionality.\& You can type \fB/\fR in
\fIitems menu\fR to start search input - enter the desired query here and press
\fBEnter\fR.\& This will generate a new list of items based on given search query.\& To
return to the original items list, you just need to make an empty search
(press \fB/\fR and \fBEnter\fR in sequence).\& Searching like that in \fIsections menu\fR and
\fIfeeds menu\fR will automatically enable explore mode and apply your search query.\&
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
.SS FEEDS FILE
.P
This file contains feed entries that Newsraft will display and process.\& There
are 4 types of lines in \fBfeeds\fR file.\&
.P
Feed lines start with a URL.\& After at least one whitespace character, the name
of the feed may be specified - it must be enclosed in double quotes.\& For
example:
.P
.RS 4
\fIhttps://example.\&org/feed.\&xml "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.P
.RE
Generator lines start with a command enclosed in \fB$()\fR.\& These act just like feed
lines but instead of fetching resources from a remote server they use the output
of the specified command to obtain the content.\&
.P
.RS 4
\fI$(cat ~/local-feed.\&xml) "Lorem Ipsum Blog"\fR
.P
.RE
Section lines start with \fB@\fR character.\& After any number of whitespace characters,
the name of the section must be specified.\& For example:
.P
.RS 4
\fI@ Software Releases\fR
.P
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:
.P
.RS 4
\fI# Look closely.\& The beautiful may be small.\&\fR
.P
.RE
Both feed and section lines allow you to set an auto update timer at the end,
which will force section or feed related to this line to be automatically
updated at a certain frequency.\& The period of automatic updates is specified in
minutes and must be enclosed in square brackets.\& If you set an auto update timer
for a feed that belongs to a section with an auto update timer set, then the
auto update timer of the feed will take precedence.\& Auto update timer of \fB0\fR
disables automatic updates.\& Let'\&s walk through a small example and see how it
all works.\& Consider this \fBfeeds\fR file:
.P
.RS 4
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed1.\&xml\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed2.\&xml [30]\fR
.P
\fI@ Replies [20]\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed3.\&xml [10]\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed4.\&xml "Forum notifications"\fR
.P
\fI@ News [60]\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed5.\&xml\fR
.br
\fIhttp://example.\&org/feed6.\&xml "Local weather" [0]\fR
.P
.RE
In this example, \fIfeed1\fR will never update automatically, \fIfeed2\fR will update
every \fB30\fR minutes, \fIfeed3\fR will update every \fB10\fR minutes, \fIfeed4\fR will update
every \fB20\fR minutes, \fIfeed5\fR will update every \fB60\fR minutes and \fIfeed6\fR will
never update automatically.\&
.P
If you just want to automatically update all feeds then you should set an auto
update timer for \fBGlobal\fR section, but before doing so, think about what load
can be exerted on a servers by frequent downloads from a large number of users.\&
Going for a small auto update timer on \fBGlobal\fR section will most likely result
in a waste of a lot of resources.\& You have been warned.\&

.SS CONFIG FILE
.P
This file is used to override default settings and bindings of Newsraft.\&
Presence of \fBconfig\fR file is totally optional and Newsraft will work without it
just fine.\& There are 3 types of lines in \fBconfig\fR file.\&
.P
Setting lines start with the \fBset\fR word.\& You can find available settings in the
\fBSETTINGS\fR and \fBCOLOR SETTINGS\fR sections.\& Format of these lines is as follows,
where \fIvalue\fR can be enclosed in single or double quotes:

.RS 4

.P
.RE
Binding lines start with the \fBbind\fR word.\& They define actions that are performed
when certain keys are pressed.\& Complete list of assigned actions can be found in
the \fBACTIONS\fR section.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction\fR
.P
.RE
There is also a way to assign command bindings.\& When a key with assigned command
binding is pressed, the specifiers in the \fIcommand\fR are replaced with values of
the corresponding entry and the command is executed.\& You can find which
specifiers are available in the description of the \fImenu-item-entry-format\fR
setting.\& Format of these lines is as follows:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fBexec\fR \fIcommand\fR
.P
.RE
Binding lines support assigning multiple actions to one key.\& Assigned actions
must be separated with semicolon symbols, for example:
.P
.RS 4
\fBbind\fR key \fIaction1\fR; \fIaction2\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand1\fR; \fBexec\fR \fIcommand2\fR; \fIaction5\fR
.P
.RE
In case you want to disable some binding which was set in Newsraft by default,
you can use a line according to this format:
.P
.RS 4
\fBunbind\fR key
.P
.RE
Comment lines start with \fB#\fR character.\& These lines are completely ignored.\& For
example:

.SS DATABASE FILE
.P
This file stores everything you download from feeds in \fBsqlite3\fR(1) format.\&

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
Newsraft'\&s behavior depends on the environment variables set, however not all
environment variables affect Newsraft directly - many environment variables
affect libraries that Newsraft is built on.\& Thus, \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl\fR(3)
recognize a large number of different environment variables which you can learn
more about on \fBncurses\fR(3) and \fBlibcurl-env\fR(3) respectively.\&
.P
However, there is one significant \fBncurses\fR(3) environment variable that is
worth mentioning here - \fBESCDELAY\fR.\& It sets delay for reading Escape key.\& It
may surprise you that its default value is 1000 ms, which is well explained
in \fBncurses\fR(3), but many may prefer a value much less than that or even 0.\&
